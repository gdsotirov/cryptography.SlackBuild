cryptography: Cryptography (Python library exposing cryptographic recipes and primitives)
cryptography:
cryptography: Cryptography is a package which provides cryptographic recipes
cryptography: and primitives to Python developers. Our goal is for it to be
cryptography: your "cryptographic standard library". It includes both high
cryptography: level recipes, and low level interfaces to common cryptographic
cryptography: algorithms such as symmetric ciphers, message digests and key
cryptography: derivation functions.
cryptography: Python 2.6-2.7, Python 3.3+, and PyPy 2.6+ are supported.
